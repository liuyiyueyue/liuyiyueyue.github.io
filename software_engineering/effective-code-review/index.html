<p>Over time, code reviews started to feel slower and heavier than they should have.
Changes were functionally ready, but sat in review queues for days or even weeks.
Each revision restarted the waiting cycle, and senior engineers increasingly
became the critical path.</p>

</h2>
<p>Two symptoms kept recurring.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="long-review-queues">
  Long Review Queues
  <a class="anchor" href="#long-review-queues">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Once a change was submitted, it often waited a long time for an initial review.
Follow-up revisions were not much better: each new version re-entered the same
queue, compounding the delay.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="senior-engineers-as-the-critical-path">
  Senior Engineers as the Critical Path
  <a class="anchor" href="#senior-engineers-as-the-critical-path">#</a>
</h3>
<p>For non-trivial changes, reviews were frequently expected from senior engineers.
This made sense from a quality standpoint, but it also concentrated review load on
a small group of people who already had many competing responsibilities.</p>
<p>Over time, this turned code review into a <strong>throughput bottleneck</strong>, not because
anyone was neglecting reviews, but because demand simply exceeded capacity.</p>
<hr>

  Stepping Back: A More General Pattern
  <a class="anchor" href="#stepping-back-a-more-general-pattern">#</a>
</h2>
<p>After looking at this more closely, it became clear that this was not just a
“review culture” issue. It was a systems problem.</p>
<p>Most code review pain can be described in terms of:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Latency</strong>: how long a change waits before receiving feedback</li>
<li><strong>Capacity</strong>: how much review load the team can absorb</li>
</ul>
<p>When capacity is fixed and latency is unbounded, queues grow silently. Each extra
review iteration adds load without increasing throughput.</p>
<p>Seen this way, many review problems are less about individual behavior and more
about <strong>how review work is structured</strong>.</p>

  What Helped on the Author Side
  <a class="anchor" href="#what-helped-on-the-author-side">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Some of the most effective improvements did not require process changes at all,
but changes in how authors prepared their changes.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="align-on-design-before-writing-code">
  Align on Design Before Writing Code
  <a class="anchor" href="#align-on-design-before-writing-code">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Submitting code that still contains unresolved design questions almost guarantees
extended review cycles. Even a brief design alignment upfront can prevent large
rewrites later.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="keep-changes-small-and-focused">
  Keep Changes Small and Focused
  <a class="anchor" href="#keep-changes-small-and-focused">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Smaller changes are easier to review, easier to reason about, and easier to
iterate on. Mixing refactors, cleanups, and new features in a single change
significantly increases review cost.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="treat-each-revision-as-review-ready">
  Treat Each Revision as Review-Ready
  <a class="anchor" href="#treat-each-revision-as-review-ready">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Incremental “partial” revisions feel efficient, but they often increase total
review time. Each revision should address all existing feedback and be ready to
merge on its own.</p>
<hr>
<h2 class="heading" id="what-helped-on-the-reviewer-side">
  What Helped on the Reviewer Side
  <a class="anchor" href="#what-helped-on-the-reviewer-side">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Reviewer behavior also played a major role.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="make-review-latency-explicit">
  Make Review Latency Explicit
  <a class="anchor" href="#make-review-latency-explicit">#</a>
</h3>
<p>When review work is treated as background activity, delays accumulate invisibly.
Having a shared expectation—such as responding within a fixed time window—helped
prevent reviews from silently stalling.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="separate-review-responsibilities">
  Separate Review Responsibilities
  <a class="anchor" href="#separate-review-responsibilities">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Not every change requires deep architectural scrutiny. A useful division was:</p>
<ul>
<li>peer reviewers for correctness and readability</li>
<li>senior reviewers for design and high-risk changes</li>
</ul>
<p>This reduced unnecessary load on senior engineers without lowering quality.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="aim-for-consolidated-feedback">
  Aim for Consolidated Feedback
  <a class="anchor" href="#aim-for-consolidated-feedback">#</a>
</h3>
<p>One common source of delay was spreading feedback across multiple rounds.
Providing more complete feedback in an initial pass, and limiting follow-up
comments to genuinely new issues, significantly reduced churn.</p>

</h2>
<p>Although this discussion started from a specific team experience, the underlying
lessons generalize well:</p>
<ul>
<li>review capacity is finite</li>
<li>latency compounds quickly</li>
<li>concentrating review responsibility creates bottlenecks</li>
</ul>
<p>Treating code review as shared infrastructure rather than an informal activity
helps teams scale without sacrificing either quality or sanity.</p>

</h2>
<p>The goal of code review is not perfection, but sustainable progress.</p>
<p>Starting from a local pain point and stepping back to examine the system helped us
identify improvements that were both practical and broadly applicable. Many teams
will recognize similar patterns, even if the details differ.</p>
