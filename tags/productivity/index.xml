      <title>Code Review Bottlenecks: From a Team Pain Point to Scalable Practices</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This post grew out of a very concrete problem in my own team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over time, code reviews started to feel slower and heavier than they should have.
Changes were functionally ready, but sat in review queues for days or even weeks.
Each revision restarted the waiting cycle, and senior engineers increasingly
became the critical path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the context was specific, the patterns were not. Similar complaints show up
in many engineering teams once codebases and organizations reach a certain size.
This post starts from that local pain point and distills several practices that
generalize well beyond a single team.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
