      <title>Code Review Bottlenecks: From a Team Pain Point to Scalable Practices</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This post grew out of a very concrete problem in my own team.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Over time, code reviews started to feel slower and heavier than they should have.&#xA;Changes were functionally ready, but sat in review queues for days or even weeks.&#xA;Each revision restarted the waiting cycle, and senior engineers increasingly&#xA;became the critical path.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While the context was specific, the patterns were not. Similar complaints show up&#xA;in many engineering teams once codebases and organizations reach a certain size.&#xA;This post starts from that local pain point and distills several practices that&#xA;generalize well beyond a single team.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
